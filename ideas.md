# Ideas for Exercism contributions

## Hints in all Hello-World / early exercises

Some of the languages generate hints with the error messages, such as Ruby. It would be good to enable this for as many languages as possible

## Description of how the tests work

Even with a basic working knowledge of the language, test code can be hard to read and follow. The Hello-World exercises for each language could have a line by line explanation for each test

## Clearer instructions on how to change project directory

The submission directory location is not clear from the documentation.

## Time not used as a metric of success

The computation time is a poor metric of success (used in one of the elixir problems, maybe others) because of different computer speeds - could use 'evaluates faster than it takes your comomputer to complete this computation'
